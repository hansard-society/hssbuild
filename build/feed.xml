    <content type="html">&lt;p class="content__p content__intro"&gt;June 2016 will be one of the most fascinating months in recent British political history. On Thursday 23rd June, Britons will head to the polls to decide whether the nation should stay in or leave the European Union.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="content__p"&gt;While opinion polls are viewed with a degree of suspicion in the UK after they failed to predict the result of last year’s general election, the most recent polling data suggests the referendum could be extremely close. The issues at stake in this referendum, which the Prime Minister David Cameron has described as a ‘once in a generation’ decision, are of huge importance. Europe and the rest of the world will be watching this historic process with great interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="content__p"&gt;This is not the only major political event that our programme will be following this coming summer. Students will arrive in London just a few weeks after 5 May, when Britons will vote for their local authorities (including, Londoners who will elect their Mayor). On the same day Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly elections will also be held. Hence the timing for a political study abroad programme couldn’t be better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="content__p"&gt;Major political developments are not merely touched upon in the Hansard Society’s Scholars programme. They shape its context and subsequently our scholars’ experience. Through their studies and placements in the heart of the British political establishment, participants on our Summer programme will have the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to get directly involved in democratic developments that will involve millions of people in the UK and affect the lives of many more around Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="content__p"&gt;In the first week of June, just a few weeks after Scotland’s general election, the first to be held in the country after the historic Scottish Independence Referendum in 2014, we will be visiting Edinburgh. We will hold meetings with Scottish commentators, lawyers, senior civil servants at the Scottish Executive, officials at the EU’s Scottish office, and MSPs of various political persuasions. It will be a unique opportunity to analyse the country’s experience of holding two historic referendums within two years, as well as the impact of the recent election on UK’s political landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="content__p"&gt;Following their study visit in Scotland, Scholars will return to London as their classes at the LSE will be getting under way. This part of the programme will provide an overview of the British political system and allow engagement with current issues in British politics. Journalists, policy analysts and leaders of local authorities will share their knowledge and expertise through our guest lectures programme. Scholars will also have the opportunity to combine these classroom based discussions with the more practical experience of their internships. They will see theoretical topics in action as they will be writing policy briefs, attending committee meetings and doing constituency work. This is hands-on-experience of day-to-day politics during an exceptionally heated political period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="content__p"&gt;This summer’s local elections and the EU referendum will create a fascinating setting for our programme, not least because it will offer a striking demonstration of how the line between domestic and international events is becoming ever more blurred. Clearly this goes to the heart of what our programme aims to achieve: to provide political knowledge and deepen our scholars’ understanding of British Politics in an increasingly competitive and globalized world. By exposing our scholars to the historic challenges facing democratic institutions and decision-makers, we facilitate their effort to broaden their horizons and prepare for substantive research as they progress in their studies.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A Welsh Love Story</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p class="content__p content__intro"&gt;When I tell people back home in Texas that I worked in the UK Parliament for Plaid Cymru, the Party of Wales, they respond with blank faces. &lt;strong&gt;“Wales? Is that in England?”&lt;/strong&gt; they say, allowing me to launch into an absurdly impassioned speech about the glories of this small, poetic nation that has fought to maintain its language and identity for hundreds of years in the face of English tyranny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="content__p"&gt;A year ago, though, I would have been as confused as everyone else. When I received my internship placement from the Hansard Society Scholars programme, the first thing I did was Google “Wales.” Is it a country? A region? And what exactly is “Plad Kimroo” anyway? When I realized on my first day of work that everyone in my office spoke Welsh fluently and often, my stomach dropped even more – I was in way over my head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="testimonial-lg testimonial-lg--text"&gt;
  &lt;p class="testimonial-lg__quote"&gt;I fell in love with Wales&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p class="content__p"&gt;But here’s the thing: there is no point studying abroad if you’re not ready to embrace the unknown. So I embraced Wales wholeheartedly, doing as much research as I could, asking my co-workers plenty of questions, and taking every opportunity I could to visit different parts of the nation. And that’s how I fell in love with Wales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="content__p"&gt;Through the Hansard study visit to Cardiff, I saw Wales’s oppressed history in Cardiff Castle and its bright future in the Senedd. After the Plaid conference in Caernarfon, I ate Welsh rarebit stew and learned about &lt;em&gt;hiraeth&lt;/em&gt;, a yearning for a long-lost home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="content__p"&gt;While campaigning in Ceredigion, I met not only my first sheep, but also my first American-turned-Welshman who had grown similarly attached to Wales on her own study abroad program. And in London, I watched my first Welsh rugby match while drinking a pint of Brains and screaming “Come on, Wales!” with a crowd of homesick Welshmen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="testimonial-lg testimonial-lg--text"&gt;
  &lt;p class="testimonial-lg__quote"&gt;One of the most awe-inspiring places in the world&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p class="content__p"&gt;Through the Hansard programme, I had the opportunity to not only intern in Parliament, one of the most awe-inspiring places in the world, but also to engage in a nation and culture I would otherwise likely never have discovered. The impact is lasting, too; after completing my senior year at Rice University, I plan to return to the UK for graduate work on the Welsh education system, a subject I became interested in after talking to my co-workers about their own schooling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="content__p"&gt;I needed to get thrown into the deep end on my study abroad, to get jolted out of my comfort zone and forced to choose between complacency and adventure. I chose the latter, threw myself into the experience, and never looked back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="content__p"&gt;So &lt;em&gt;diolch&lt;/em&gt;, Hansard, for introducing me to Wales. I think we will be very happy together.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p class="content__p content__intro"&gt;Hansard Society scholars are &lt;strong&gt;aspiring global leaders&lt;/strong&gt; who engage with policy issues at local, national and international levels and build lasting networks abroad. Alumni of this selective and rigorous programme go on to pursue highly successful careers in politics and public service, the law, civil society, academia and commerce. They have included state governors, attorney generals, diplomats, heads of faculty at world-leading universities and business leaders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="content__p"&gt;The programme takes a holistic and highly interactive approach to the study of parliamentary democracy and modern British politics. In addition to &lt;a href="/academics/#internship" class="link"&gt;working in Westminster&lt;/a&gt;, scholars examine nationalism and devolution first hand during the &lt;a href="/academics/#study-trips" class="link"&gt;integral study visits&lt;/a&gt; to the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh and the National Assembly for Wales in Cardiff, providing a truly comparative experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="testimonial-lg testimonial-lg--text"&gt;
  &lt;p class="testimonial-lg__quote"&gt;Learn about topical issues from senior politicians&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p class="content__p"&gt;Regular guest lectures, as well as invitations to high profile events at Westminster, enable scholars to learn about the topical issues of the day from senior politicians, media commentators, prominent academics and experts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="content__p"&gt;Our bespoke &lt;a href="/academics" class="link"&gt;political science courses&lt;/a&gt; are taught by academics from leading British institutions and are offered in association with the London School of Economics and Political Science.  Scholars have full access to the LSE’s world-renowned social science collection.*&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="content__p"&gt;Administered by the UK’s leading parliamentary think tank, Hansard Society Scholars is unique among study abroad political internship programmes. Through the Society’s exceptional links with the Palace of Westminster and the devolved legislatures, the programme provides an unrivalled opportunity to undertake pre-professional work experience with key figures in British politics. Taken alongside academic courses that underpin the programme, the placement challenges scholars to understand and apply theoretical concepts and research within a working environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="content__p"&gt;All of this and more takes place in one of the world’s greatest capital cities, steeped in history and tradition and rich in culture, yet modern and vibrant.  There is something for everyone in London.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="content__p"&gt;We hope you will enjoy reading about the experiences of some of our recent scholar alums in our new &lt;a href="/blog" class="link"&gt;‘Westminster Calling’ blog&lt;/a&gt;, starting with the &lt;a href="/2016/02/01/a-welsh-love-story/" class="link"&gt;discovery of a whole nation by Melanie Zook!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="content__p"&gt;Our application process has been redesigned to make the experience as simple as possible. All application materials can be submitted online, but the option to mail us your documents is still available.  Please feel free to contact us if you have any questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="footnote"&gt;* This Programme should not be confused with the LSE’s own Parliamentary Internship scheme.&lt;/p&gt;
